He primarily makes videos about New York City.</p><p>From listings in New York to apartment tours and vlogging about his daily life, Conover is the source of much of the New York City real estate knowledge on the platform.</p><p>However, as he mainly makes content about impossibly expensive places, many people view his videos not as a way to buy the listings he provides but as a form of entertainment.&nbsp;</p><p>He has amassed over 2.08 million subscribers through this method, and his channel seems to grow more daily. However, Conover is not free of scrutiny as many people have been talking about his personal life and tribulations.</p><h2>Quick Facts About Erik Conover</h2><table class="table table-bordered content-table"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Age:</strong></td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth:</strong></td><td>$2 Million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession:</strong></td><td>Youtuber</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality:</strong></td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Date of Birth:</strong></td><td>October 21, 1989</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Place of Birth:</strong></td><td>Pomona, New Jersey</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Residence:</strong></td><td>New York City, New York</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Style:</strong></td><td>Vlogs, Travel</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Videos:</strong></td><td>205</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Subscribers:</strong></td><td>2.08M</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=who-is-hanna-coleman>Who Is Hanna Coleman?</h2><p>Hanna Coleman is also a YouTuber who creates content focusing on vlogs and her life in New York City.</p><p>She joined Youtube on February 13, 2013, and posted her first video on April 7, 2019. Since then, she has amassed 41K subscribers and released 11 videos.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/9/0ce259c0-42df-4945-9450-0d40bca381fa.webp></p><p>She is also popular on Instagram, where she has 21K followers. She makes content about living in New York City, but unlike Conover, her content revolves around her life in the city rather than traveling or listings in upscale neighborhoods.</p><p>Coleman seems like a normal caucasian girl in her early 20s enjoying her life in the big apple. However, she gained prominence because of her relationship with Erik Conover and the mysterious fallout of their relationship.</p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Did Erik Conover And Hannah Coleman Split?</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Erik Conover and Hannah Coleman have completely erased their relationship from the <a href=# rel=noopener>internet</a>.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The two met in mid-2018 at a coffee shop in Hudson Yards. Conover was pushing 30 when they meant, while Coleman had recently entered her 20s.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The gap in their power dynamic would not seem so evident initially but would show itself soon into the relationship. </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Coleman quit her job shortly after meeting Conover and started working with him at his production company.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/9/b78591b4-56f4-4328-b03b-61dd558404e5.webp></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>They started dating in 2019, and not long after the beginning of their relationship, Conover proposed to Coleman.&nbsp; </span>The pair enjoyed much success as Conover's channel grew together for almost three years.&nbsp;</p><p>Newspapers like The New York Post commented on their success, and Conover joined the luxury residential and commercial brokerage firm Nest Seekers International alongside Coleman.&nbsp;</p><p>Coleman joined Nest Seekers as its head of digital marketing and strategy. The two weren't only surviving; they were thriving.</p><p>Then 2021 rolled around, and things took a drastic shift. Coleman deleted every instance of Conover from her social media, and Conover did the same.&nbsp;</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/9/39fa6aa2-3df1-45dd-897e-4a659524196f.webp></p><p>A huge chunk of 2020 has been excised from their social media accounts. Though the two have been very quiet about their breakup, reading between the lines shows that things are very wrong.</p><p>Coleman was the first to speak out, albeit in tongues when she released two videos on her channel. The first video, titled "life update," was released on February 16, 2021, and the second video, titled "changing my life... what I've been up to," was released on April 17, 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>In both of these videos, Coleman talked about moving out of New York City to focus on the clients she had amassed from her Nest Seekers job, but what people caught onto were the things she didn't say or hint at.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/9/0e36c268-48c4-4f62-b050-51383176b5fe.webp></p><p>Things like putting yourself first, not letting anyone dictate your life, and believing in yourself. As Coleman posted the videos soon after her breakup, many people understood that she was referring to her relationship with Conover.</p><p>Conover did not respond in a video but did post comments here and there stating that Coleman had broken his heart and that he would not want to marry for a long time.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=who-is-erik-conover-wife>Who Is Erik Conover's Wife?</h2><p>Erik Conover does not have a wife, and given the situation with Hanna Coleman, it's unlikely he will marry soon.</p><p>After Hanna Coleman released her videos, there was an understated but seething backlash against Erik Conover.</p><p>Here is where the difference in the power dynamic between them became apparent.&nbsp;</p><p>Many people saw the disconnect between them and started speculating and filling the gaps in what Coleman didn't mention.&nbsp;</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/9/1946e038-f98a-4d4c-9b12-b72d127ed035.webp></p><p>Some speculations included that Conover didn't let Coleman have her own time in the sunlight and wanted her to remain his number two.</p><p>Other people stated that his dating someone not only a decade younger but just recently turned legal was very distasteful.</p><p>But that was all a year ago, and though a small part of the <a href=# rel=noopener>internet </a>is still interested in Conover and Coleman's drama, it seems that both parties and many of their fans have moved on.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-erik-conover->How Much Is Erik Conover's Net Worth?</h2><p>Erik Conover is an American YouTuber who has a net worth of $2 million.</p><p>The YouTuber has earned the bulk of his wealth from his Youtube channel. He started the channel on March 29, 2012, and posted his first video on November 22, 2016.</p><p>Since then, Conover has posted 205 videos on his channel. His first video, which showed him apartment hunting in New York City, was a far cry from his recent videos.&nbsp;</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/9/586d711a-70f9-4bb9-856b-f8dcb0882946.webp></p><p>His initial videos were less ornery than his current content and had a homely feel.&nbsp;</p><p>His family was also a common feature of these early videos. There was also a period in 2017 when Conover traveled to different parts of the world, from Thailand to Norway, to Iceland, and Finland.</p><p>He even climbed Mount Kilimanjaro. However, as his content grew, he started molding it to the videos he now makes.&nbsp;</p><p>He uploaded the first video to showcase his channel's new direction on April 16, 2018. The video entitled "Inside a Massive $20 Million NYC Townhouse | NYC Luxury Apartment Tour." Since then, the homely feel of Conover's has been supplanted by a commercial sheen.&nbsp;</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/9/9c842bd5-a121-47d1-a41a-93c58f7ac25e.webp></p><p>The Youtuber can't be faulted for the shift in his content, as the videos have been very successful.</p><p>The most successful video on his channel has amassed 29 million views. Of the 205 videos he has uploaded, 66 have reached or surpassed a million views.</p><h2>How Does Erik Conover Make Money?</h2><p>Like many YouTubers, Erik Conover makes money through the Youtube platform itself via AdSense.</p><p>Youtube pays its content creators through the advertisements it runs on its videos. The content creators earn $2-$12 per 1000 monetized videos after Youtube takes its cut.</p><p>The content creator is paid more the longer viewers watch their video. So, it's hard to state just how much Conover has earned from Youtube, but looking at his net worth, he has earned a pretty penny.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/9/9163aac1-2ab0-43c2-9cc8-b0cacd071afc.webp></p><p>As stated above, the Youtuber has had multiple videos pass a million views, which surely has added to his bank account.</p><p>Though many Youtubers have become millionaires through the platform, Conover is one of the few known by the public as a Youtube millionaire.</p><p>Then there are Conover's other platforms. The Youtuber has a big following on Instagram and Tiktok.&nbsp;</p><p>He has 427K followers on Instagram and 485.9K on TikTok. The man earns income from both these platforms, especially TikTok, as he has received 8.2 million likes since he started the channel.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/9/43b674c2-d65f-4e25-b1a0-b5b35fb1ee6e.webp></p><p>Another way most Youtubers make money that applies to Conover is sponsorships and paid promotions.</p><p>Many companies pay Youtubers so they will showcase their products on their page. What separates Conover from most other Youtubers is that instead of companies, residences and listings are the ones who sponsor the Youtuber so that he can show the residences and locations on his channel.</p><p>Conover, a real estate agent for the lucrative Nest Seekers International, has earned much money through his real estate and content creation skills. He has earned the right to be called the Youtube millionaire.</p><p>Read More About Youtubers Here: <a title="Twitter Reacts To Chase Crossing Face Reveal On Reddit" href=# rel=noopener>Twitter Reacts To Chase Crossing Face Reveal On Reddit</a></p><h2>How Much Are Erik Conover's Career Earnings?</h2><p>Strictly looking at his total view count, Erik Conover has made $3,339,441 from his main channel.</p><p>This amount is derived by calculating his total view count of 278,286,817 against the $2-$12 scale of what YouTube pays.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the amount is also under the assumption that Conover has received $12 for every 1000 monetized views, which is impossible to say for sure.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/9/d4d85731-24a4-442e-92a8-4bd56e358feb.webp></p><p>One can assume that Conover's earnings must be greater than his net worth, which is $2 million, so $3 million is a nice spot to land when it comes to his earnings from his main channel.</p><p>The Youtuber also has two side channels, though they are not as successful as his main one.</p><p>The two channels are called Erik Conover Originals and Erik Conover Vlogs. The former has 2.75K, and the latter has 21.9K subscribers.</p><p>Despite the two channels having a sizeable amount of subscribers, it's easy to assume that they don't count towards his income because the Originals channel has five videos, all posted eight months ago, and nothing since, and the Vlogs channel does not have any content at all.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/9/ae08fe76-a4ae-419f-b1a9-7099de724ba6.webp></p><p>It's the Youtuber's TikTok channel that counts towards his total earnings. Though TikTok doesn't pay as much as Youtube, since a thousand views only make between 2 and 4 cents, a popular content creator can still supplement their income through the app.</p><p>All in all, Conover has built a great life and career out of talking about buildings. Though he has not escaped controversy and backlash, as it stands, he is not under a great fire; it's just that people think he was a poor boyfriend and is a poor ex-boyfriend.</p><p>Given his wealth and influence, he'll live.&nbsp;</p><p>Read More About Youtubers Here: <a title="What Is Jentzen Ramirez's Net Worth?
