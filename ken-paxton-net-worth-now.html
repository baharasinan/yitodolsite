The committee’s justification for Paxton’s impeachment and removal from office was a long history of alleged wrongdoing and criminal activity.</p><p>Despite being a significant step in the Attorney General’s favour, the Texas House Committee’s decision is not the end of his political career.</p><p>The House General Investigating Committee unanimously resolved to refer articles of impeachment to the full chamber during a specially called meeting on Thursday afternoon.</p><p>The House will then choose whether to accept the accusations made against Paxton, which could result in the removal of the Attorney General’s title while the Senate conducts a trial.</p><p>The impeachment of an Attorney General is unquestionably a pivotal act in American political history.</p><p>This bold and unprecedented action has always been saved for public officials whose misuse of authority was unequivocally established and beyond reproach.</p><p>The timing of the committee’s judgement has caused severe concerns about its reliability.</p><p>The Texas House Committee made its decision shortly after a representative from Paxton’s office asked to testify before the House committee looking into Paxton’s alleged criminal acts and referred to the committee’s efforts as “illegal.”</p><p>The public deserves to hear from the Attorney General’s office regarding the current inquiry, according to Chris Hilton, chief of general litigation.</p><p>Hilton continued, “Ken is what the voters want, but this committee is doing everything it can to suppress the voters’ freedom and will.”</p><p>Naturally, Ken Paxton did not remain silent after being subjected to such serious accusations.</p><p>Paxton responded on Twitter with a brief but impactful statement.</p><p>“It is a sad day in Texas as we witness the corrupt political establishment unite in an illegitimate attempt to overthrow the will of the people and disenfranchise the voters of our state,” Paxton said in a statement released later on Thursday.</p><p>Security fraud and improper use of his authority to assist a friend and political donor are among the accusations made against Ken Paxton.</p><p>Only the Texas House has the authority to initiate the impeachment process against state officials, which would result in a Senate trial. Paxton would be removed from office in accordance with the Texas Constitution pending the conclusion of the Senate trial.</p><p>Two-thirds of the Senate would need to agree to and approve Ken Paxton’s removal from office. Only twice in Texas’ history has this occurred.</p><p>Possibly very soon, Texas citizens will see it happen a third time. Ken Paxton’s net worth would be the least of his concerns at this point, and with good reason.</p><h3>Ken Paxton is under fire</h3><p>It appears that Ken Paxton was cursed in the start of May. A lady was recently detained after being accused of setting fire to a politician’s office.</p><p>The suspect, a 42-year-old woman, allegedly ignited a fire by <a href=#>accident</a> after tossing a burning cigarette in a trash can.</p><p>Officials from the Department of Public Safety questioned the suspect about why she started the fire before stating that it was an entirely inadvertent act of negligence.</p><p>However, the woman is accused of causing criminal mischief and must pay a fine of at least $25,000 but not more than $30,000.</p><p>The video of the alleged arson was shared on Twitter by the Texas Attorney General.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>We are looking to identify a person of interest in an arson. Please contact the Austin Fire Department if you have information that can help solve this crime. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Xb5MaWquSd</a></p><p>— Texas Attorney General (@TXAG) <a href=#>May 25, 2023</a></p><p>Thankfully, neither human lives nor office property were endangered.</p><p>Next, let’s look at the education background and early years of the Texas attorney general.</p><h3>A glance at Ken Paxton’s family</h3><p>On December 23, 1962, Ken Paxton was born at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota, where his father had been stationed during his time in the US Air Force.</p><p>The politician’s upbringing was completely different from his current way of life and financial situation. He grew raised mostly in a caravan with his parents, siblings, and other family members.</p><p>Whenever his father worked, Paxton’s caravan was parked outside and lacked modern conveniences like air conditioning.</p><p>People are curious about every part of your life when you are renowned, regardless of how tragic or ancient they are.</p><p>In a similar vein, one of the few parts of Ken Paxton’s life that follows him around is his eye damage.</p><p>Paxton nearly lost an eye in a game of hide-and-seek when he was twelve years old. Although the occurrence itself didn’t pose a problem, his condition’s incorrect diagnosis led to long-term eyesight issues.</p><p>His healthy eye is therefore green, as opposed to his damaged eye, which is brown and drooping. While attending college, he further hurt his sight.</p><h3>Ken Paxton’s academic credentials</h3><p>Paxton graduated from Baylor University with a psychology degree in 1985 and a master’s degree in business administration in 1986.</p><p>When the Texas leader was chosen to lead the student government at his alma institution, his authoritative and leading qualities initially came to light.</p><p>Ken Paxton then spent the following two years working as a management consultant before going back to school in 1988.</p><p>The University of Virginia conferred a Juris Doctor degree on Paxton in 1991.</p><p>Let’s examine the politician who is currently notorious’s pay and wealth last but not least.</p><h3>Ken Paxton net worth & salary</h3><p>Since January 2015, Paxton has been the attorney general of Texas. The Attorney General has not only become well-known in politics but has also amassed a wealth.</p><p>The current range of Ken Paxton’s net worth is $5 to $10 million. He is among the wealthiest politicians and attorneys in the United States.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/icon-256x256-1-150x150.png alt="ken paxton salary,kenneth c griffin net worth,ken paxton office phone number,ken paxton eye injury,what does ken paxton do,ken paxton email address,ken griffin net worth 2023,attorney general child support,bill paxton net worth 2020,ken paxton actor" itemprop=image sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Divesh Solanki</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Being a binge-watcher himself, finding Content to write about comes naturally to Divesh.
