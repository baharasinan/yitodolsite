Further, her grandparents are Hattie Bell Fishburne, and Laurence John Fishburne, Jr. As per her education, she might be studying in an elementary school.&nbsp;</p><h3>Is Delilah Dating Anyone Currently?</h3><p>No, there is no way to date any partner at the current moment because of her age. She is just in her mid teenage so it is too early to talk about the romantic relationship. Thus, she might be focusing on her studies or spending quality time with her family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/4/27/8a4d0b16871cc5ac316b98539256a59d-1587960352789.jpg><p>&nbsp;Delilah, meanwhile, stays away from the spotlight or media.</p><h2>Parents Were Together for 17 Years</h2><p>On the other hand, her mother and dad cherished each other's most intimate moments of their lives. They met in 2001 through a common friend. They fell in love shortly and began dating each other.</p><p>Laurence and Gina later announced their engagement in February 2001 and married on 22 September 2002. The wedding ceremony was taken at The Cloisters Museum in New York City in the presence of their parents and friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/4/27/Laurence-Fishburne-Wife-Marriage-Wedding-Gina-Torres-1587960111413.jpg><p>Fishburne's spokesman Alan Nierob revealed after five years of marriage on January 8, 2007, that they were expecting their first child together who was Delilah. Things went sour between them, however, and it was reported on September 20, 2017, that they were separated on September 20, 2017.</p><p>The actor Fishburne subsequently filed for divorce on 2 November 2017. The divorce was finalized immediately by the court on May 11, 2018, and they reached a final settlement on April 16, 2018, after 17 years of reconciliation.</p><h2>Dad's Previous Relationship</h2><p>The actor who had his first debut by portraying Joshua Hall on the ABC soap opera One Life to Live was married to his first wife,<strong> Hajna O. Moss</strong>. They tied the knot in 1985 in New York, United States.</p><p>The exes have two children, son <strong>Langston Fishburne</strong> who was born in 1987 and daughter <strong>Montana Fishburne</strong> who was born on <i>7 September 1991</i>. Hajna and Laurence divorced in the 1990s only after 5 years of unity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/4/27/gettyimages-587937656-1024x1024-1587960511293.jpg><p>Delilah's half-siblings Montana made <a href=# rel=nofollow>headlines </a>as she tried to break into the Hollywood industry by publishing a sex tape, as did<strong> Kim Kardashian</strong>.

Likewise, they first met on the set of the 1992 movie <i>Deep Cover</i>.</p><h2>How Wealthy is Delilah Fishburne?</h2><p>The 15-year-old celebrity kid is two young to start her own career. Moreover, she is dedicated to her studies and will soon finish her primary education just like <a href=#>Alabama Gypsy Rose Jennings</a>.</p><p>Fortunately, because both parents came from the entertainment industry, she'd risen to fame. In the future, she will follow in the footsteps of her parents. But for now, she has no source of revenue.</p><p>Delilah's father Laurence Fishburne has a net worth of <strong>$20 million</strong>.
