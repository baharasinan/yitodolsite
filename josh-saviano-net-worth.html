He is a lawyer and former child actor, probably best known for playing Paul Joshua Pfeiffer in the television series “The Wonder Years”.</p><p>So just how rich is Joshua Saviano at present? Sources state that Saviano has collected a fortune over $500,000, as of early 2017. His net worth has been accumulated through his involvement in the entertainment industry, as well as during his career in law.</p><h3>Josh Saviano Net Worth $500,000</h3><p>Saviano grew up in Northern New Jersey. He attended Yale University, majoring in Political Science, and then in 2000 he enrolled at Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, at Yeshiva University in New York City, graduating in 2003.</p><p>His acting career started by appearing in a commercial for Aim toothpaste during his childhood years. In 1988 he was cast in the comedy-drama television series “The Wonder Years”, to play the role of Kevin Arnold’s best friend, Paul Joshua Pfeiffer. The role earned him a decent level of recognition in the acting world, and it also greatly contributed to his net worth. He remained on the show until its cancellation in 1993.</p><p>Embracing the fame earned by his performance of Pfeiffer, Saviano went on to appear in other projects as well, both on the big and small screen, which further increased his popularity and improved his wealth. Alongside “The Wonder Years”, the same year he landed a part in the comedy film “The Wrong Guys”, playing Kid Belz. The following year saw him appearing in the television series “The <a href=#>Ray Bradbury</a> Theater”, in the role of Willie. He also had a voice role in the series “Reading Rainbow”, before appeared as himself in the series “Life with Kelly” in the same year. In 1990 Saviano portrayed Max Plotkin in the TV film “Camp Cucamonga”, and also appeared as a celebrity contestant in the Fox children’s television game show “Fun House”. All added to his net worth.</p><p>Following the end of “The Wonder Years” in 1993, Saviano abandoned his acting career to focus on education. He enrolled at Yale, graduating in 1998. He then began working as a paralegal for a law firm located in New York City, and later worked for an Internet firm, his wealth growing steadily.</p><p>In 2000 he enrolled at Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, and was admitted to the bar in New York after he obtained his law degree. He began working as an associate at the New York City law firm Morrison Cohen LLP, being promoted to Senior Counsel in 2011 and to Partner two years later, greatly increasing his fortune.</p><p>He left the company in 2015, and founded two start-up endeavors: the law firm called JDS Legal, and celebrity brand consultancy called Act 3 Advisors, which have since served as the main sources of his income and growing net worth.</p><p>In 2014, Saviano combined his two careers by playing the role of a lawyer in an episode of the televisions series “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit”.</p><p>When it comes to his private life, Saviano is married to Jennifer Saviano, who is also a lawyer. The couple has one child together and the family resides in New York City.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=8.6363636363636><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Josh Saviano</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$500,000</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>March 31, 1976</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>White Plains, New York, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.83 m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Lawyer, Actor</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Yale University, Benjamin N.
