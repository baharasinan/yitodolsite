However, he ended up not gelling with new Celtics head coach <a href=# title="Rick Pitino Net Worth">Rick Pitino</a>, and had persistent problems with the coaching staff. This led to Billups being traded by the team after 51 games.</p><h2 id=toronto-raptors><strong>Toronto Raptors</strong></h2><p>Billups was traded to the Toronto Raptors in early 1998. In a total of 29 games with the team, he averaged 11.3 points and 2.7 rebounds per game.</p><h2 id=denver-nuggets-1999-2000><strong>Denver Nuggets, 1999-2000</strong></h2><p>In early 1999, Billups was dealt to the Denver Nuggets, his hometown team. He finished up the season with the team averaging 13.9 points and 2.1 rebounds per game in 45 games. The next season, Billups played in just 13 games before being traded to the Orlando Magic. However, due to an injured shoulder, he never played for the Magic.</p><h2 id=minnesota-timberwolves><strong>Minnesota Timberwolves</strong></h2><p>Billups made his way to the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2000. That season, he appeared in 77 games as the team reached the first round of the playoffs. In the 2001-02 season, Billups played in a career-high 82 games as the Timberwolves again reached the first round of the playoffs.</p><h2 id=detroit-pistons-2002-2008><strong>Detroit Pistons, 2002-2008</strong></h2><p>After becoming a free agent, Billups signed a five-year contract with the Detroit Pistons in 2002. He had immediate success with the team, helping the Pistons finish first in the Eastern Conference with a 50-32 record for the regular season. In the playoffs, the team made it to the Eastern Conference Finals, losing to the New Jersey Nets in four games. Billups and the Pistons went on to have an incredible 2003-04 season, culminating in an upset victory over the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals. In the championship, Billups averaged 21 points, 5.2 assists, and 3.2 rebounds per game; he was subsequently named the NBA Finals MVP. The Pistons reached the NBA Finals again in 2005, but fell to the San Antonio Spurs. Billups became a co-captain of the team in 2006, and helped lead the Pistons to a franchise-best 64-18 record. In the 2007 offseason, he signed a new, four-year contract with the Pistons. The team made it back to the Eastern Conference Finals in 2008, but lost to the Celtics.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-356852 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Chauncey-Billups-1.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-356852 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Steph Chambers/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=denver-nuggets-2008-2011><strong>Denver Nuggets, 2008-2011</strong></h2><p>Billups was traded back to his hometown Nuggets in late 2008.

The team ended up finishing the season 42-40 and securing the sixth seed in the Easter Conference, good enough for a playoff berth. In the playoffs, Billups was sidelined with a knee injury as the Knicks were eliminated in the first round.</p><h2 id=los-angeles-clippers><strong>Los Angeles Clippers</strong></h2><p>After being put on waivers by the Knicks, Billups was claimed by the Los Angeles Clippers.

Once again, however, injuries got in his way, causing him to miss most of the season and post career lows in multiple categories. Following the season, the Pistons declined to pick up their team option on Billups' contract for the next season. Billups announced his retirement from NBA playing later in the year.</p><h2 id=national-team-career><strong>National Team Career</strong></h2><p>Beyond the NBA, Billups played for the US men's national basketball team.
