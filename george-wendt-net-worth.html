George Wendt is best known for playing the role of Norm Peterson in the TV sitcom "Cheers." George appeared <a href=#>in all 275 episodes of "Cheers" between 1982 and 1993</a>. He won considerable acclaim for this performance, earning himself six consecutive Emmy nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. Outside of television work, Wendt has appeared in films such as "Fletch," "Gung Ho," "Dreamscape," "House," "Forever Young," "Hostage for a Day," "Man of the House," and "Lakeboat."</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>George Robert Wendt Jr. was born on October 17th, 1948 in Chicago, Illinois. He was raised in the Chicago neighborhood of Beverly, Illinois alongside eight siblings in a family with Irish and German heritage. His grandfather was a well-known photographer named Tom Howard. Actor <a href=#>Jason Sudeikis</a> is his nephew. George's older sister is Jason's mother. Although he was born in Chicago, he actually attended high school in Prairie du Chien in Wisconsin.</p><p>After graduating from high school, Wendt attended the University of Notre Dame and received a 0.00 GPA during his first semester. This resulted in his immediate expulsion. However, George continued his post-secondary education at Rockhurst College in Kansas City, Missouri. He attended class this time and eventually graduated with a B.A. in economics.</p><h2 id=early-career><strong>Early Career</strong></h2><p>After leaving college, George Wendt became involved with The Second City, which is a comedy troupe based in Chicago. This group is famous for producing various well-known actors, and George joined them in the 70s. However, his first job wasn't all that glamorous, as he was tasked with sweeping the floors. During his time with Second City, Wendt met his future wife, Bernadette Birkett. She would later appear alongside George in several episodes of "Cheers." The couple went on to have three children together.</p><p>George Wendt eventually started acting professionally in the early 1980s with small roles in movies like "My Bodyguard." His early TV roles came with series like "Taxi," "Soap," and "M*A*S*H."</p><h2 id=cheers><strong>Cheers</strong></h2><p>George Wendt's true breakthrough came in 1982, when he booked the role of Norm Peterson in the series "Cheers." He would eventually appear in every single episode of the series, which spanned 275 episodes and ran until 1993. During this period, George was nominated for six Emmys but failed to win each time.</p><h2 id=cheers-salary><strong>Cheers Salary</strong></h2><p>At the peak of his time on "Cheers" George Wendt earned $200 thousand per episode. That worked out to around $5 million per season. After adjusting for inflation, that's the same as earning around $10 million per year in today's money.</p><h2 id=after-cheers><strong>After Cheers</strong></h2><p>After "Cheers" finally came to a close, George explored a wide range of additional acting opportunities. During his time on the show, he had appeared on "Saturday Night Live." He also found time to appear in films such as "Never Say Die."
