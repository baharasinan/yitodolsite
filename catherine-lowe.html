It’s really easy for us because we’re just a regular, married couple with kids.”</p><p>And as one of the show’s longest-lasting couples’, the pair insist they don’t feel any sort of pressure. “We’re married and that’s not going to change till we get old and I die, and then she can remarry a younger guy,” the season 17 Bachelor alum joked.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>“I think we don’t even think of ourselves as a Bachelor couple in that way, anymore. We’re so normal and we’re just living a wonderful life as parents to new kids,” Giudici, 32, chimed in.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-914 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>But even after five years of marriage, the pair, who&nbsp;partnered with Nutrisystem, know how to keep their relationship exciting. “Recently, Sean surprised me with a trip to Paris, which was pretty romantic,” she gushed. “I couldn’t have asked for a better gift from Sean.”</p><p>Still, like any other couple, Lowe and Giudici have their turn-ons and turn-offs about each other. For Lowe, “I’m very clean and I love the line, ‘Cluttered house, cluttered mind.’ So when Catherine cleans the house, oh I’m turned on, definitely,” he joked, adding: “It’s the same as her wearing lingerie.”</p><p>As for Giudici? “I’m a creative,” she explained. “I like to say that, and that is my excuse for being messy. And I have two children!”</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-915 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Meanwhile, the Nutrisystem ambassadors are&nbsp;loving watching their boys grow up. “[Samuel] is such a sweet little boy,” Giudici gushed. “He helps his brother, he shares his food with him, his toys, he’s always interested in what’s Isaiah’s doing and they just could not be more obsessed with each other. It is so sweet to see.”</p><p>But don’t expect them to be watching&nbsp;The Bachelor&nbsp;anytime soon. “Our kids are not old enough for&nbsp;The Bachelor,” the dad joked. “I’m not sure I’m old enough for&nbsp;The Bachelor!</p><h2>Catherine Lowe Interview</h2><p><strong>Source:&nbsp;www.parents.com&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Catherine Lowe:&nbsp;</strong>Parenthood is going to be an amazing process. It will be what we want it to be and we can’t wait.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><p><strong>Is that why you’re celebrating your transition into parenthood with the hashtag #Amazinghood?</strong></p><p><strong>Sean Lowe:</strong>&nbsp;Absolutely. So many of our friends always refer to parenthood as being amazing. Even my guy friends that don’t seem soft or sensitive can’t stop&nbsp;talking&nbsp;about how amazing parenting is!</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_16"></span><p><strong>What are you most excited about?</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_12"></span><p><strong>CL:</strong>&nbsp;I really just can’t wait to introduce our baby to the dogs! Kidding—kind of. But I’m looking forward to that.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-917 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_13"></span><p><strong>SL:&nbsp;</strong>I’m looking forward to taking naps with the baby and letting it fall asleep on me.</p><p><strong>So, you’ve decided to keep the baby’s gender a surprise. Are you all for gender-neutral nursery design?</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_19"></span><p><strong>SL:</strong>&nbsp;Definitely.&nbsp;Our design taste is neutral! We wouldn’t have chosen colors for the nursery based off of the baby’s gender, even if we knew what it was.</p><p><strong>CL:</strong>&nbsp;I have had the easiest pregnancy, ever. I need to remind myself that I’m&nbsp;pregnant&nbsp;sometimes, which is a huge blessing. I’ve been able to do everything I need to do before the baby gets here. There’s so much to take care of, prepping for a baby, so I’m grateful my pregnancy isn’t holding me back from getting things done. I feel like I can’t even attribute my easy pregnancy to anything!</p><p><strong>SL:</strong>&nbsp;I even have to remember she’s pregnant! She handles it like a champ.</p><p><strong>There’s a huge “Bachelor” baby-boom right now. Are you able to find support from any other “Bachelor” stars going through the same thing?</strong></p><p><strong>CL:</strong>&nbsp;Absolutely. Ali Fedotowsky and I have been in constant communication. We’re so close in timing too—she’s just one week behind me. We’re expecting a lot of the same things, though she is having a harder time with her pregnancy. Desiree [Hartstock]&nbsp;and&nbsp;Jillian [Harris]&nbsp;just announced their pregnancies—and there’s even more!—but those are the ones I connect with.</p><p><strong>Catherine, how has Sean supported you during pregnancy? How do you think he will do as a first-time father?</strong></p><p><strong>CL:&nbsp;</strong>He’s been great. He’s always there for me and I know he will be the best dad. I’ve said this before, and I’m half-kidding since it’s not comparable, but he is the best doggy-daddy and I just know he’s going to be a great dad.</p><p><strong>Sean, how do you think Catherine will do as a new mom?</strong></p><p><strong>SL:</strong>&nbsp;She’ll be an unbelievable mom. I’ve never met anyone that loves as hard as she does. When she puts her heart into something, she puts everything into it. I know that will transition to our child and it will be so cool to watch her take that motherly role.</p><h3>About InformationCradle Editorial Staff</h3><p>This Article is produced by <strong>InformationCradle Editorial Staff</strong> which is a team of expert<strong> writers</strong> and <strong>editors</strong> led by <a href=#><strong>Josphat Gachie</strong></a> and trusted by millions of readers worldwide.</p><p>We endeavor to keep our content <strong>True</strong>, <strong>Accurate</strong>, <strong>Correct</strong>, <strong>Original</strong> and <strong>Up to Date</strong>.
