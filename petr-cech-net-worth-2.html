He was an immediate success with the club; in March 2005, he set a Premier League record of 1,025 minutes without conceding a goal. Chelsea went on to win the Premier League title. For keeping a record 24 clean sheets in the 2004-05 season, ÄŒech earned his first Premier League Golden Glove. He continued his success in the 2005-06 season as Chelsea won a second consecutive Premier League title. Early the next season, ÄŒech suffered a near-fatal head injury when he collided with Reading midfielder Stephen Hunt in Chelsea's penalty area. He underwent surgery for a depressed skull fracture and was out of play for about three months. ÄŒech made his return in a loss to Liverpool in January 2007, during which he debuted the rugby-style headguard he would wear for the rest of his career. After that, he resumed his goalkeeping prowess, going around 810 minutes of Premier League play without conceding a goal. With ÄŒech's clean sheet in the 2007 FA Cup final, Chelsea emerged victorious.</p><p>ÄŒech signed a new, five-year contract with Chelsea in the summer of 2008.
