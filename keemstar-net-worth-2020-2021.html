Keem, popularly known as Killer Keemstar, is an American YouTuber and vlogger who is the host of the biggest YouTube news show, DramaAlert. Prior to his involvement in YouTube, Keemstar was part of the popular gaming squad, Faze Clan.</p><p>Maybe you know about Keemstar very well But do you know how old and tall is he, and what is his net worth in 2024? If you do not know, We have prepared this article about details of Keemstar’s short biography-wiki, career, professional life, personal life, today’s net worth, age, height, weight, and more facts. Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life</h2><p>The YouTube star was born on March 8, 1982, in Buffalo, New York, United States. Keemstar traces his ancestral roots from Italy, Germany, and Denmark. His parents are Italians, and he has two other siblings, a brother and a sister. Keemstar has a daughter called Mia. Keemstar boasted via Twitter that his daughter has a lot of money in her bank account, probably more than an entire family’s net worth.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on 8 March 1982, Keemstar is 42 years old as of today’s date 21st July 2024. His height is 1.68 m tall, and his weight is 75 kg.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Keemstar was initially a member of F.A.G (The Federation of Asshole Gamers), a group of YouTubers who made trolling videos about Halo. Back then, he was known as DJ Keemstar.</p><p>Keemstar did not start his online career as a well-planned and already thought of an idea. His career started as a hobby where he would post about Twitter feuds between YouTubers. His posts would have the hashtag, #DramaAlert. Fans loved what he did, and he quickly became popular. He uploaded a video of one of his posts, and that was when his YouTube career took shape.</p><p>He officially launched the YouTube channel as NewDramaAlert on June 15, 2014. Over 300,000 people subscribed to his channel within its first year after its launch. Despite the popularity of the channel, the channel was also heavily criticized for posting controversial content.</p><p>He was accused of being a racist after he called a moderator, Alex, on Battlecam.com, a nigger. This later became a meme, and some people even made compilation videos of him. In 2016, YouTube also came under heavy criticism for live streaming underage girls who appear half-naked. Although the videos in question date back to 2010, the issue still caused a stir. He had to step down as host of the show for a week to allow issues to cool down.</p><p>2016 was not a good year for the YouTuber as the issues keep piling up. Keemstar got himself into another problem when he posted a video talking about how he cannot wait to report on the death of TotalBiscuit. TotalBiscuit had initially revealed that he had terminal cancer. He later apologized to TotalBiscuit, but the harm had already been done. Even though he deleted the video, people were quick to make copies before he decided to delete it.</p><p>Even though Keemstar had been initially banned for owning a YouTube channel, he found out in 2016 that he now had access to the account. Keemstar’s channel reached one million subscribers in February 2016. In July 2017, the number of subscribers increased to 2 million. He finally reached 3 million subscribers in October 2017.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>There are no records of awards won by the popular YouTuber.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary of Keemstar in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Keemstar-Net-Worth.jpg><p>As of July 2024, Keemstar has an estimated net worth of $3 million. His growing YouTube channel is his primary source of income. In 2014, Keemstar Tweeted that his net worth is much more than what has been revealed to the public. There are, however no records to prove his claims.</p><p>The contents of Keemstar’s YouTube channel is still questionable to a lot of people, including fellow YouTubers. In 2015, a petition was opened on change.org, demanding that Keemstar’s YouTube channels be closed. The petition cited the racism scandal and other claims. The basis for the petition was that Keemstar’s channel harasses innocent people. They also stated that the channel is a platform for Keemstar to promote his fabricated stories. Even though the petition received the 5000 signatures, the petition did not succeed in helping to take down Keemstar’s channel.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLHApauhsaCav7S7zaxlnKedZLimscysq5qqXaOytXnWqKmtoF1nfXN8jGtna2lf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./leon-spinks-net-worth-2020-2021.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Leon Spinks Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki">&larr;
