One of his parents, Christian Ollivier, was a sports journalist at Radio Television Luxembourg (RTL), which deeply impacted him.</strong></p><p>Samuel admits he likes being on the radio more than anything else.</p><p>Ollivier made up his mind to become a <a href=#>journalist</a> like his dad after watching France win the 1998 World Cup on television.</p><p>While he was watching the World Cup, he started dreaming of covering that glorious event.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/French-Journalist-Samuel-Ollivier-e1691479497773.jpeg><p>While still a Journalism student at ISCPA, Samuel Ollivier got a contract offer from RTI L’ Equipe, a radio station owned by RTI Group.</p><p>It was a massive opportunity for someone in his early twenties, so he gave up his studies to do a job for a radio.</p><p>He did pretty well in his field for a dropout, but he does not suggest the same for other journalism students.</p><p>After working for beIN Sports for a decade, Ollivier became a sports columnist for Telematin, a tv program airing on France 2.</p><p>Aside from that, he is still associated with L’ Equipe and is a presenter of Liga 1 football for Prime Videos.</p><h2>Samuel Ollivier Parents, Christian, And Mother</h2><p>Samuel Ollivier was born to his parents around 1988 in Paris, France. Even though there is no mention of his birthdate on the Internet, the journalist revealed that he was ten when France lifted the World Cup trophy in 1998.</p><p>Growing up with his younger siblings in Paris, Samuel saw many fascinating things, but his favorite was the media.</p><p>His dad, Christian Ollivier, was a popular media personality, and there was no day without him seeing his dad speak on tv and radio.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Samuel-Olliviers-Father-Christian-e1691486062266.jpg><p>Born in 1961, Christian began his journalism career in 1983, working for RTL Group.</p><p>After working for over a decade there, the company promoted him to the director of the station’s sports department in 1997.</p><p>The veteran journalist previously hosted a program named On refait le match about soccer every Saturday. Unfortunately, he had a fallout with the management, so he quit the station recently in 2023.</p><p>Moreover, the Association of Sports Writers in France awarded him the Sports Commentator Award in 2013 for his contribution to sports journalism.</p><p>There is a great deal of information about Samuel’s famous dad, but sadly, there is no reliable information about his mother on the Internet.</p><p>Staying in the shadows, Samuel’s mom supported her husband and sons while they pursued their dreams.</p><h3>Samuel’s Younger Brother Is Also A Journalist</h3><p>Samuel Ollivier’s younger brother, Jordan Ollivier, <a href=# rel=noopener>is also a journalist</a>. Following in his father and brother’s footsteps, he began his journalism career in 2018, when he was in the final years of his college.</p><p>He initially did his undergraduate studies at SKEMA Business School and thought of doing differently than what his dad and older brother did.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Samuel-Olliviers-Younger-Brother-Jordan-Ollivier-e1691486184581.jpg><p>Continuing his higher education, he later earned his Master’s in International Marketing and Business Development from the same institute.</p><p>The following year, he changed plans and enrolled at ESJ Paris, where he did his master’s in Journalism.</p><p>While pursuing his Journalism degree, he began working as a sports reporter for RMC Sports.&nbsp;</p><p>At present, Jordan works as a journalist for Telefoot, a football program for TF1, a French commercial tv channel.</p><p>Moreover, in 2022, he traveled to Qatar and covered the World Cup for the TF1 network.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC%2FwKasnqRdpLmttdWinKtloJa%2FprrTrGY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./gethin-jones-depression-katherine-jenkins-split.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gethin Jones opens up about 'awful depression' following Katherine Jenkins split">&larr;
