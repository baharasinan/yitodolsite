Sharon will get updates on Phyllis Summers’ (Michelle Stafford) arrest and make Chance a cup of celebratory coffee.</p><p>Once Chance sees all the paperwork for Kirsten Incorporated, Sharon will explain that Cameron Kirsten (Linden Ashby) left it to her.</p><p>Now that Sharon plans to revitalize the company, she’ll feel like it’s giving her a sense of purpose and revitalizing her life, too.</p><p>Chance will also learn that Sharon pitched a merger to Adam Newman (Mark Grossman), so she’ll be hopeful about everything working out.</p><p>Sharon’s enthusiasm will turn Chance on, so they’ll end up kissing passionately before Sharon locks the door.</p><p>As Chance and Sharon start to strip down, they’ll decide to take this back to Sharon’s office for the sake of privacy. Sharon and Chance will sizzle on the sofa before canoodling in the aftermath with no regrets.</p><p>At the jazz lounge, Adam will join Nick Newman (Joshua Morrow) at the bar, where Nick will push him to leave Sharon alone and stop finding ways to drag her down.</p><p>Adam will point out that Sharon came to him about the merger, but Nick won’t care and will think Adam needs to shut the idea down.</p><p>After Adam says he had to risk his freedom and give up a bodily organ for Faith Newman (Reylynn Caster) to get Nick to be civil, he’ll note that it didn’t last long.</p><p>Nick and Adam will ultimately get on the same page about their attempt to be real brothers being a failure every time. It’ll leave Adam and Nick feeling like there’s no need to keep pushing for peace.</p><p>As for whether Nick will go along with Victor Newman’s (Eric Braeden) suggestion to work with Adam, he’ll suggest Adam talked him out of it.</p><p>In a GCAC suite, Victoria Newman (Amelia Heinle) will lounge in bed with Nate Hastings (Sean Dominic), who’ll assure her that their connection is about more than just sleeping together.</p><p>After Victoria asks what Nate wants out of this relationship, he’ll insist he wants it all. Nate will hope to keep working with Victoria and become the kind of couple that thrives off that energy at home, too.</p><p>At the ranch, Victor will seem defeated as he sits at his chess board and talks to Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott) about giving his children too much free rein.</p><p>Once Victor decides to make some changes, he’ll summon Nick, Adam, Victoria and Nate with a cryptic text. Nick will arrive first, but Adam won’t be far behind.</p><p>Adam will bring up Adustus International, which is the new name he’s chosen for McCall Unlimited.</p><p>Victor will mention that adustus means singed and burnt, but Adam will note that he prefers scorched – as in scorched earth.</p><p>After Adam points out that he sees through Victor’s attempt to manipulate him and control his future, Nate and Victoria will walk in. Victor will ignore Adam’s complaints as he kicks off this meeting.</p><p>Once Victor explains that he offered his children too much power and freedom, he’ll declare that he calls the shots from now on. Victor will make it clear that all of them are going to do exactly what he wants them to do.</p><p>Starting tomorrow, Victor will order Nick to help Adam run Adustus while Nate continues as Victoria’s COO.</p><p>Once Adustus becomes a strong, viable company, Victor will plan to make it a subsidiary of Newman Enterprises like it should’ve been long ago.</p><p>Adam will remind Victor that they had an agreement, but Victor won’t “give a damn” about what he agreed to in the past.</p><p>If Adam and the others don’t like this arrangement, Victor will invite them to walk out the door.</p><p>Nick will go along with Victor’s wishes before Victoria says he hasn’t really left her much of a choice. When Victor turns to Adam for his answer, Adam will stomp off in a fit of rage.</p><p>Once Nate returns to Victoria’s office with her, she’ll pour them some drinks and sport a satisfied smirk.</p><p>Nate will realize this is the outcome Victoria wanted all along – though she’ll admit she could’ve done with less scolding.</p><p>At the athletic club, Audra Charles (Zuleyka Silver) will seem concerned over a text Nate sent her earlier, but she won’t give Tucker McCall (Trevor St. John) the details when she runs into him at the bar.</p><p>Tucker will be a little drunk as he rambles about how great everything is going in his life. Audra will want the scoop, but Tucker will decide not to jinx it by filling her in.</p><p>When Tucker sees that Kyle Abbott (Michael Mealor) is texting her, he’ll be surprised over Audra thinking he can tie in with a promising future.</p><p>Tucker will advise Audra to have fun with Kyle, but he won’t think she should expect much!</p><p>Audra, on the other hand, will see real potential for Kyle and will mention that she hired him to be her right-hand man at Newman Media.</p><p>Tucker will ask if that was before or after a little roll in the hay, but Audra will refuse to play this game.</p><p>After Tucker bets Audra a trip to Vegas with him that Kyle will let her down, she’ll refuse to take the bet. Tucker will assume that’s because Audra knows she’ll lose, but Audra will claim she doesn’t want to ruin his winning streak.</p><p>Once Audra texts Kyle to meet her in her suite in half an hour, Y&R spoilers say she’ll head upstairs as Tucker watches.</p><p>Meanwhile, Chance and Sharon will still be cuddling after lovemaking when someone starts banging on the door to Crimson Lights.</p><p>After Sharon notices she has two missed calls from Adam, she’ll get dressed and open the door to him.</p><p>While Chance stays hidden in the back, Adam will tell Sharon that Victor pulled a fast one and caused him to walk away from Adustus.</p><p>That’ll make the merger moot, but Adam will insist he’d be happy to work with Sharon and help her turn Kirsten Incorporated around.</p><p>Adam will add that he wants nothing more to do with his family or his father, so Sharon will have to process that news.</p><p>Back at the ranch, Nick will assume Adam’s going to change his mind and go along with Victor’s wishes. This could lead to Adam becoming more volatile and unpredictable than ever.</p><p>Victor will promise that if Adam doesn’t get in line, then he’s done with him!</p><p>The Young and the Restless spoilers say Victor will continue to lay down the law, so stay tuned.</p><p>CDL will have other exciting <a href=# rel=noopener>Young and the Restless spoilers, updates and news, so stop by often for more Y&R info.</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWxnpJ2ybsXOrqWgZZGjsW7Ax55kq52jqbmmv9JmqZ6bkaV6rrvNnZiyZZqqubp5kHBkmpyRonqlsdGaoKWrXai1or7Op6pmoJ%2Bpeq%2B1xqGrZq%2BZqbVur8eapZydXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./val-kilmer-net-worth-2024-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Val Kilmer Net Worth 2024">&larr;
