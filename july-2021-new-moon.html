The month was riddled with a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Mercury retrograde in Gemini</a>, a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>game-changing solar eclipse</a> in the mercurial air sign, and other tense planetary meet-ups.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And now, the first full month of summer serves up a new moon — happening on Friday, July 9 in the cardinal water sign Cancer — that's set to deliver welcome, sweet, eye-opening change.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The new moon in Cancer will help you channel your feelings into rebellion.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Cancers</a> tend to be thought of as sentimental, emotional caregivers who — as the ruler of the fourth house of home life — prioritize family above all else. They also have a rep for being moody and snuggling up into their shells, refusing to come out until they've thoroughly processed their emotions. For that reason, you might assume that any astrological event hosted by Cancer would be all about swimming in the deep end of all the feels. But one aspect of the water sign that seems to get lost in sweeping characterization is the fact that they're one of the cardinal signs (the others being Aries, Libra, and Capricorn) who excel at initiation and big picture ideation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In that way, it makes perfect sense that this Cancer new moon isn't about sitting in a pool of feelings. It's actually far more action-oriented, thanks to not only the cardinal nature of the Crab, but the most prominent connection that the moon will make, which is a pleasant sextile to Uranus, the planet of rebellion, revolution, and out-of-the-blue, sudden change. It's the ruling planet of fixed air sign Aquarius — known for striking out against convention at every turn.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So the message of this moment is to identify how you're feeling and then, allow it to fuel big changes and breakthroughs that this new moon is intent on bringing.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>You can count on Uranus to shore up your sense of self.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We've all had those moments when we've wanted one thing but said we want the other — for a variety of reasons, whether that's to be more accepted socially or to please someone we care about. And in the days surrounding this new moon, you might be compelled to look at reasons why you've hidden your genuine self or put your individual needs on the backburner. You'll want to stand even more in your truth and embrace whatever it is that makes you unique. In short, you could see no reason why this isn't the perfect moment to let your freak flag fly — and see how that can change, well, just about everything.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There's also an emphasis on relationships, as Venus — the planet of love, beauty, and money — currently moving through confident Leo will be squaring off against Uranus in fellow fixed sign Taurus. It could be that your sense of self, your needs, your desires, your vision for the future triggers unexpected upheaval in a partnership. Or, if you're single, you could have an epiphany about what you need romantically — or even sexually.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Either way, you'll want to buckle up and prepare yourself for plenty of surprises and excitement. This lunar event is wired to turn the mundane upside down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here, how this Cancer new moon will affect you, based on your sign. (Pro-tip: Be sure to read both your sun and your rising sign, if you know it. If you don't, you can find it on your natal chart or via this <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>CafeAstrology calculator</a>.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Aries (March 21-April 19)</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With the new moon lighting up your fourth house of home life and second house of income, shake-ups could ultimately boost your security and sense of calm.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Taurus (April 20-May 20)</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Your third house of communication and first house of self are activated by this new moon, urging you to use your voice in a whole new way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Gemini (May 21-June 20)</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With the new moon stirring up action in your second house of income and twelfth house of spirituality, getting in tune with your intuition and values is the key to making the most of this moment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Cancer (June 21-July 22)</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Falling in your first house of self, this new moon is your annual opportunity to own your individuality and dreams for the future.

Your eighth house of emotional bonds is a factor here, too, so intimate relationships and joint resources can propel your success.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Scorpio (October 23-November 21)</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Your ninth house of adventure and seventh house of partnership are activated by this new moon, so being open to personal growth and change, especially within your closest one-on-one bonds, can prove game-changing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sagittarius (November 22-December 21)</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The new moon activates your eighth house of emotional bonds and sixth house of health, so you'll want to consider how close connections dovetail with your mental and emotional well-being — and how you might need to change course.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Capricorn (December 22-January 19)</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Your seventh house of partnership and fifth house of romance shape your focus during this new moon, so relationships, self-expression, and reciprocity are prime themes.
