The movie power couple first crossed paths in 2001 while Tim was working on the Movie, Planet of the Apes with Helena in the starring role.</p><p>Even before they started dating, there were speculations that the duo was romantically involved while on set. However, the rumors were proved right when they publicly declared their relationship after the movie’s premiere.</p><p>While their relationship lasted, the celebrity duo was like a match made in heaven. Though they had their issues, Tim and Helena appeared to complement each other.

She would love them to join mundane professions like accountancy or law.</p><p>Though Billy loves to live a private life away from the public eye, he has been severally spotted making public appearances with his parents.
